What is the factory pattern

-> When a method returns one of several possible classes that share a common super class

    -> Create a new enemy in a game
    -> Random number generate picks a number assigned to a specific enemy
    -> The factory returns the enemy associated with that number

-> The class is chosen at run time

-> When you don't know ahead of time what class object you need
-> When all of the potential classes are in the same subclass hierarchy
-> To centralize class selection code
-> When you don't want the user to have to know every subclass
-> To encapsulate object creation

The Factory Pattern allows you to create objects without
specifying the exact class of object that will be created
